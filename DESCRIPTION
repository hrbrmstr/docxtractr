Description: 'Microsoft Word' 'docx' files provide an 'XML' structure that is fairly
    straightforward to navigate, especially when it applies to 'Word' tables and
    comments. Tools are provided to determine table count/structure, comment count
    and also to extract/clean tables and comments from 'Microsoft Word' 'docx' documents.
    There is also nascent support for '.doc' files.
SystemRequirements: LibreOffice (<https://www.libreoffice.org/>) required to extract 
    data from .doc files.
